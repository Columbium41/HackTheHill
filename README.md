## Inspiration
File Share was inspired by projects that utilized a Peer-to-Peer connection system to communicate between people on the web. For instance, [justbeamit](https://justbeamit.com/) is a similar app that allows users to share files. 

## What it does
File Share is a React web application that uses WebRTC connections via. PeerJS; it allows users to upload and share files with their own unique links using a Peer-to-Peer connection system. This web application was made during [Hack The Hill](https://hackthehill.com/), an annual hackathon held at the University of Ottawa.

## How we built it
We made this web app using the React JavaScript library and PeerJS, a wrapper for WebRTC. Additionally, we used Netlify to deploy our web app. 

## Challenges we ran into
- Understanding and learning how to implement WebRTC into the web app
- Debugging JavaScript
- Learning how to efficiently use git and github in a collaborative environment

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
At the end of the day, [me and my teammates](#Collaborators) are proud that we made a (semi) functional web app from scratch in 48 hours. None of our teammates have used WebRTC before so we were glad we could make a final product with what little knowledge we had.

## What we learned
- React & Client-side routing
- The basics of WebRTC and PeerJS
- How to use git and github to collaborate on code

## What's next for File Share
- Uploading more than one file
- Not having to refresh the page to upload more files
- Better methods of sending data
